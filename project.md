## Features and Performance Speed of Central Processing Units

I applied machine learning techniques to investigate the features of a central processing unit (CPU) and which feature affects the CPU performance the most. Below is my report.

***

## Introduction 

Central Processing Units are really important and are the primary components of a computer that is responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. The first central processing unit is developed in 

## Data

Here is an overview of the dataset, how it was obtained and the preprocessing steps taken, with some plots!

## Modelling

Here are some more details about the machine learning approach, and why this was deemed appropriate for the dataset. 

<p>
When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
  \[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.\]
</p>

The model might involve optimizing some quantity. You can include snippets of code if it is helpful to explain things.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import ExtraTreesClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
X, y = make_classification(n_features=4, random_state=0)
clf = ExtraTreesClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=0)
clf.fit(X, y)
clf.predict([[0, 0, 0, 0]])
```

This is how the method was developed.

## Results
